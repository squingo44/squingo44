Hello, my name is David "squingo44" Rosof-Williams.

I recently graduated from Warwick with a degree in Maths and Physics.

I'm interested in applying my mathematical background to a career in quantitative modelling.

I'm currently teaching myself Python, and exploring the basics computer science and methods of data analytics.
